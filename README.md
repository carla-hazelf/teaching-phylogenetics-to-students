# teaching-phylogenetics-to-students
This workshop was developed and delivered by myself, Carla Hazel Finn, with input from Wilda Laux, in collaboration with Genomics Aotearoa. This was made as part of a workshop to inform teachers in Aotearoa-NZ on new concepts emerging in the biological sciences.
The level of this workshop is anticipated to be suitable for CB 1.3. It can be used as a resource to teach students about Phylogenetic trees and using DNA to trace origins; 
However, this workshop also discusses: Mutation a a cause of variation, Genetic Variation, and Natural selection.


In this activity, students will explore the evolutionary relationships among ratites by performing two complementary activities:
1.	Manual DNA Sequence Alignment: In the first part, students will complete a hands-on activity to manually align simplified nucleotide sequences from different ratite species. By identifying similarities and differences in the sequences, they will gain an understanding of how sequence alignments work.
2.	Computer-Based Sequence Alignment: In the second part, students will use a computational tool (Clustal Omega) which aligns actual nucleotide sequences from more ratite species. This tool allows the analysis of much longer and more complex sequences quickly and accurately. From the computer-generated alignment, students will visualise a phylogenetic tree that represents the evolutionary history of the ratites.
Together, these exercises will give students a deeper appreciation of how genetic data can be used to map the evolutionary paths of species and the benefits of using bioinformatics tools in research.
