# teaching-phylogenetics-to-students
This workshop was developed and delivered by myself, Carla Hazel Finn, with input from Wilda Laux, in collaboration with Genomics Aotearoa. This was made as part of a workshop to inform teachers in Aotearoa-NZ on new concepts emerging in the biological sciences.
